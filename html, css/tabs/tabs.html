          Named for a local swamp fish, Paraty sits on Brazil's southeastern
          coast, 125 miles south of Rio, with the Bocaino Mountains at its back.
          The small colonial town's center is a national historic monument with
          well-preserved buildings on its pedestrian-only streets.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
          The town is located on the Bay of Ilha Grande, which is dotted with
          many tropical islands. Rising as high as 1,300 meters behind the town
          are tropical forests, mountains, and waterfalls. It is the
          southernmost and westernmost city in Rio de Janeiro state.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
          The city's economic activity revived as a port for a new boom, the
          coffee trade of the Paraiba do Sul River Valley in the early 19th
          century, until a railway along the valley created cheaper transport to
          the port of Rio de Janeiro.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
          There are many musical and cultural events, the most prominent of
          which is the FLIP – Festa Literaria Internacional de Paraty
          (International Literary Festival of Paraty). The town is also known
          for its local festivals on Catholic holy dates, such as the Feast of
          the Holy Ghost.

          When the city was founded in 1531, the founders made Nossa Senhora dos
          Remédios as the patron Saint and built a church in her honor. The
          center of the city is focused on the pedestrian section of the old
          town. Here is where the phenomenal Portuguese colonial architecture
          can be found. In total, the center consists of a 30 block grid, with
          terraced houses and Baroque churches.

          Near Parati lies the Mata Atlantica, which is a lush, unruly jungle
          metropolis. This Rainforest is Brazil's national treasure.

        <p class="article-paragraph">
          The Portuguese settled Paraty in the mid-seventeenth century. By the
          1800's Paraty had become the second most important port in Brazil
          because of the gold found in Minas Gerais.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
          The village of Paraty was founded in 1597. It was established formally
          as a town by Portuguese colonists in 1667, in a region populated by
          the Guaianás Indians.
